# Feature-Selection-Using-Bayes-Deep-Learning
This project investigates the efficacy of Bayes Deep Learning (BayesDL) and the TASSEL
Mixed Linear Model (MLM) in feature selection for whole-genome SNP data, focusing on
their application to two datasets: the TASSEL test data and the Arabidopsis thaliana
dataset. The primary objective is to identify significant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
(SNPs) associated with phenotypic traits, comparing the performance of a deep learning
approach against a traditional statistical method. BayesDL, designed for high-dimensional
data, demonstrates strong capabilities in detecting complex, non-linear associations, particularly
in the Arabidopsis dataset. However, its computational demands highlight the need
for substantial resources, making it challenging to scale for larger datasets. Conversely, TASSEL
MLM, with its robust handling of population structure and genetic relatedness, proves
effective in simpler genetic environments, providing clear and interpretable results. The
comparative analysis suggests that while BayesDL offers superior performance in complex
scenarios, TASSEL MLM remains a valuable tool for initial SNP exploration in datasets with
less genetic complexity. The findings emphasize the potential benefits of integrating both
methodologies into a hybrid approach, combining the probabilistic strengths of BayesDL with
the robust population control of MLM, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of genotypephenotype
association studies. This integration could significantly advance genomic research
and plant breeding strategies, offering more comprehensive insights into genetic architecture.
